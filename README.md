ðŸ““ Incident handlerâ€™s journal capturing decision-making and event response from a blue team perspective.

**Project Title**: *Incident Handlerâ€™s Journal: Documenting Real-Time Response*

**Project Introduction**: This project involved maintaining a structured journal while responding to simulated incidents. I tracked observations, decisions, and incident status across multiple stages.

**Modeling and Evaluation**: The journal used the SANS incident response framework (Preparation, Identification, Containment, Eradication, Recovery, Lessons Learned). Effectiveness was evaluated by completeness and timeliness of entries.

**Conclusion**: The journal helped reinforce methodical response processes. Future development may include turning journal entries into incident response templates or runbooks.
