## Case Study 1: DNS Server Failure Investigation
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate network analysis skills**

### Scenario
Multiple customers reported inability to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com, receiving "destination port unreachable" errors. As a cybersecurity analyst, I investigated the network traffic to identify the root cause of this service disruption.

</details>

### Technical Analysis
**Key Findings:**
- **UDP Protocol:** Used for DNS queries from browser to DNS server
- **ICMP Protocol:** Used for error message responses from DNS server
- **Error Pattern:** Consistent "udp port 53 unreachable" across all attempts
- **DNS Flags:** Query ID 35084+ with "A?" flag indicating DNS A record lookup

### Incident Report: DNS Server Failure Investigation

**Problem Summary:** As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was used to contact the DNS server to retrieve the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com. The ICMP protocol responded with error messages indicating "udp port 53 unreachable," suggesting the DNS server is not responding.

**Root Cause:** The DNS server might be down due to a DoS attack or misconfiguration, preventing DNS resolution and making the website inaccessible.

## Case Study 2: SYN Flood DoS Attack Analysis
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate DoS attack analysis skills**

### Scenario
A travel agency's website experienced service disruption when employees reported connection timeout errors. I investigated unusual network traffic patterns using Wireshark to identify the cause.

### Technical Analysis
**Attack Pattern:** SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Key Evidence:**
- Large volume of TCP SYN requests from IP 203.0.113.0
- Web server overwhelmed by abnormal traffic volume
- Legitimate connections failing with timeout errors

### Incident Report: SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Section 1: Attack Identification**
A DoS attack caused the connection timeout errors. The logs show the web server stopped responding after being overloaded with SYN packet requests - characteristic of SYN flooding.

**Section 2: Attack Mechanism**
The TCP three-way handshake process:
1. **SYN:** Client requests connection
2. **SYN-ACK:** Server acknowledges and reserves resources  
3. **ACK:** Client confirms connection

In a SYN flood attack, the malicious actor sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming server resources and preventing legitimate connections.

### Immediate Response Actions Taken

**Mitigation Steps:**
- Took web server offline temporarily for recovery
- Configured firewall to block malicious IP (203.0.113.0)
- Implemented continuous traffic monitoring

**Long-term Recommendations:**
- Deploy SYN flood protection mechanisms
- Configure intrusion detection systems
- Establish incident response procedures

## Case Study 3: Brute Force Attack & Malware Distribution
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate incident response and malware analysis skills**

### Scenario
A former employee executed a brute force attack against yummyrecipesforme.com, gaining administrative access using default credentials. The attacker then embedded malicious JavaScript code that prompted visitors to download malware, redirecting them to a fake website (greatrecipesforme.com).

<details>
<summary><strong>View Attack Timeline</strong></summary>

1. **Initial Access:** Brute force attack using default admin password
2. **Code Injection:** Malicious JavaScript embedded in website source code
3. **Malware Distribution:** Visitors prompted to download executable file
4. **Traffic Redirection:** Users redirected to greatrecipesforme.com
5. **Account Lockout:** Admin password changed, preventing legitimate access

</details>

### Technical Analysis

**Network Protocols Identified:**
- **DNS Protocol:** Used for domain name resolution (yummyrecipesforme.com ‚Üí IP address)
- **HTTP Protocol:** Primary protocol for web traffic and malware delivery
- **TCP Protocol:** Underlying transport layer communication

**Attack Progression:**
1. Browser initiates DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com
2. HTTP connection established to compromised website
3. Malicious file downloaded via HTTP
4. Browser redirected to greatrecipesforme.com via new DNS/HTTP requests

### Security Incident Report: Brute Force Attack & Malware Distribution

**Section 1: Network Protocol Analysis**
The primary protocol involved in this incident is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The malicious file was transported to users' computers using HTTP at the application layer. Additionally, DNS protocol was used for domain resolution throughout the attack sequence.

**Section 2: Incident Documentation**
Several customers contacted the helpdesk reporting prompts to download files for "free recipes" when visiting the website. After running the files, their computers operated slowly and browsers redirected to a different site.

Investigation using a sandbox environment and tcpdump revealed:
- The compromised website prompted downloads of malicious files disguised as browser updates
- Network traffic analysis showed redirection from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com
- Source code analysis confirmed JavaScript injection prompting file downloads
- The attacker used a brute force attack to gain admin access with default credentials

**Section 3: Remediation Recommendations**
**Primary Recommendation: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

2FA requires both password authentication and confirmation of a one-time passcode sent to email or phone. This prevents brute force attacks from succeeding even if passwords are compromised, as attackers would need access to the secondary authentication method.

**Additional Security Measures:**
- Enforce strong, unique passwords and disable default credentials
- Implement account lockout policies after failed login attempts  
- Monitor and log administrative access attempts
- Regular security code reviews to prevent malicious injections
