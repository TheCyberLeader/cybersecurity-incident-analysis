## Case Study 2: SYN Flood DoS Attack Analysis
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate DoS attack analysis skills**

### Scenario
A travel agency's website experienced service disruption when employees reported connection timeout errors. I investigated unusual network traffic patterns using Wireshark to identify the cause.

### Technical Analysis
**Attack Pattern:** SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Key Evidence:**
- Large volume of TCP SYN requests from IP 203.0.113.0
- Web server overwhelmed by abnormal traffic volume
- Legitimate connections failing with timeout errors

### Incident Report: SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Section 1: Attack Identification**
A DoS attack caused the connection timeout errors. The logs show the web server stopped responding after being overloaded with SYN packet requests - characteristic of SYN flooding.

**Section 2: Attack Mechanism**
The TCP three-way handshake process:
1. **SYN:** Client requests connection
2. **SYN-ACK:** Server acknowledges and reserves resources  
3. **ACK:** Client confirms connection

In a SYN flood attack, the malicious actor sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming server resources and preventing legitimate connections.

### Immediate Response Actions Taken

**Mitigation Steps:**
- Took web server offline temporarily for recovery
- Configured firewall to block malicious IP (203.0.113.0)
- Implemented continuous traffic monitoring

**Long-term Recommendations:**
- Deploy SYN flood protection mechanisms
- Configure intrusion detection systems
- Establish incident response procedures

## Case Study 3: Brute Force Attack & Malware Distribution
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate incident response and malware analysis skills**

### Scenario
A former employee executed a brute force attack against yummyrecipesforme.com, gaining administrative access using default credentials. The attacker then embedded malicious JavaScript code that prompted visitors to download malware, redirecting them to a fake website (greatrecipesforme.com).

<details>
<summary><strong>View Attack Timeline</strong></summary>

1. **Initial Access:** Brute force attack using the default admin password
2. **Code Injection:** Malicious JavaScript embedded in website source code
3. **Malware Distribution:** Visitors prompted to download executable file
4. **Traffic Redirection:** Users redirected to greatrecipesforme.com
5. **Account Lockout:** Admin password changed, preventing legitimate access

</details>

### Technical Analysis

**Network Protocols Identified:**
- **DNS Protocol:** Used for domain name resolution (yummyrecipesforme.com ‚Üí IP address)
- **HTTP Protocol:** Primary protocol for web traffic and malware delivery
- **TCP Protocol:** Underlying transport layer communication

**Attack Progression:**
1. Browser initiates DNS request for yummyrecipesforme.com
2. HTTP connection established to the compromised website
3. Malicious file downloaded via HTTP
4. Browser redirected to greatrecipesforme.com via new DNS/HTTP requests

### Security Incident Report: Brute Force Attack & Malware Distribution

**Section 1: Network Protocol Analysis**
The primary protocol involved in this incident is HTTP (Hypertext Transfer Protocol). The malicious file was transported to users' computers using HTTP at the application layer. Additionally, the DNS protocol was used for domain resolution throughout the attack sequence.

**Section 2: Incident Documentation**
Several customers contacted the helpdesk, reporting prompts to download files for "free recipes" when visiting the website. After running the files, their computers operated slowly, and browsers redirected to a different site.

Investigation using a sandbox environment and tcpdump revealed:
- The compromised website prompted downloads of malicious files disguised as browser updates
- Network traffic analysis showed redirection from yummyrecipesforme.com to greatrecipesforme.com
- Source code analysis confirmed JavaScript injection prompting file downloads
- The attacker used a brute force attack to gain admin access with default credentials

**Section 3: Remediation Recommendations**
**Primary Recommendation: Implement Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**

2FA requires both password authentication and confirmation of a one-time passcode sent to email or phone. This prevents brute force attacks from succeeding even if passwords are compromised, as attackers would need access to the secondary authentication method.

**Additional Security Measures:**
- Enforce strong, unique passwords and disable default credentials
- Implement account lockout policies after failed login attempts  
- Monitor and log administrative access attempts
- Regular security code reviews to prevent malicious injections

## Case Study 4: Network Security Risk Assessment & Hardening
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate network hardening and vulnerability assessment skills**

### Scenario
A social media organization experienced a significant data breach, compromising customer personal information. As a security analyst, I conducted a comprehensive network security assessment to identify vulnerabilities and develop recommendations for hardening to prevent future incidents.

<details>
<summary><strong>View Identified Vulnerabilities</strong></summary>

**Critical Security Vulnerabilities:**
1. Employees sharing passwords across systems
2. Database admin password set to default credentials  
3. Firewalls lacking traffic filtering rules
4. No multi-factor authentication implementation

</details>

### Security Risk Assessment Report

**Part 1: Selected Hardening Tools and Methods**

Three hardening tools the organization can implement to address the vulnerabilities:

1. **Implementing Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA)**
2. **Setting and Enforcing Strong Password Policies** 
3. **Performing Regular Firewall Maintenance**

**Tool Descriptions:**
- **MFA** requires users to verify credentials through multiple methods (fingerprint scans, ID cards, PINs, passwords) before accessing applications
- **Password policies** include rules for password length, acceptable characters, sharing restrictions, and account lockout after unsuccessful login attempts  
- **Firewall maintenance** involves regularly checking and updating security configurations to stay ahead of potential threats

**Part 2: Implementation Recommendations**

**Multi-Factor Authentication Benefits:**
MFA adds a security layer beyond passwords, reducing the likelihood of successful brute force attacks since multiple authentication methods are required. It also discourages password sharing since recipients would need additional authentication factors, making shared passwords less useful.

**Password Policy Enforcement:**
Strong password policies make it increasingly challenging for malicious actors to access the network. Account suspension after a certain number of failed login attempts prevents brute force attacks. Requirements for password complexity, frequent updates, and preventing password reuse help avoid network infiltration.

**Firewall Maintenance Strategy:**
Regular firewall maintenance ensures rules reflect current security standards for allowed/denied traffic. Suspicious traffic sources should be added to deny lists, and rules must be updated after security events. This protects against various DoS and DDoS attacks by controlling network access points.

### Implementation Timeline & Frequency

| Security Measure | Implementation Frequency | Priority Level |
|---|---|---|
| MFA Deployment | One-time setup, ongoing user management | High |
| Password Policy Updates | Monthly review, immediate enforcement | High |
| Firewall Rule Maintenance | Weekly reviews, immediate post-incident updates | Critical |
