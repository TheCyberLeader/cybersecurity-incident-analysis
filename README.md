## Case Study 1: DNS Server Failure Investigation
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate network analysis skills**

### Scenario
Multiple customers reported inability to access www.yummyrecipesforme.com, receiving "destination port unreachable" errors. As a cybersecurity analyst, I investigated the network traffic to identify the root cause of this service disruption.

</details>

### Technical Analysis
**Key Findings:**
- **UDP Protocol:** Used for DNS queries from browser to DNS server
- **ICMP Protocol:** Used for error message responses from DNS server
- **Error Pattern:** Consistent "udp port 53 unreachable" across all attempts
- **DNS Flags:** Query ID 35084+ with "A?" flag indicating DNS A record lookup

### Incident Report: DNS Server Failure Investigation

**Problem Summary:** As part of the DNS protocol, the UDP protocol was used to contact the DNS server to retrieve the IP address for yummyrecipesforme.com. The ICMP protocol responded with error messages indicating "udp port 53 unreachable," suggesting the DNS server is not responding.

**Root Cause:** The DNS server might be down due to a DoS attack or misconfiguration, preventing DNS resolution and making the website inaccessible.

## Case Study 2: SYN Flood DoS Attack Analysis
**Note: This is an educational simulation designed to demonstrate DoS attack analysis skills**

### Technical Analysis
A travel agency's website experienced service disruption when employees reported connection timeout errors. I investigated unusual network traffic patterns using Wireshark to identify the cause.

### Technical Analysis
**Attack Pattern:** SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Key Evidence:**
- Large volume of TCP SYN requests from IP 203.0.113.0
- Web server overwhelmed by abnormal traffic volume
- Legitimate connections failing with timeout errors

### Incident Report: SYN Flood DoS Attack

**Section 1: Attack Identification**
A DoS attack caused the connection timeout errors. The logs show the web server stopped responding after being overloaded with SYN packet requests - characteristic of SYN flooding.

**Section 2: Attack Mechanism**
The TCP three-way handshake process:
1. **SYN:** Client requests connection
2. **SYN-ACK:** Server acknowledges and reserves resources  
3. **ACK:** Client confirms connection

In a SYN flood attack, the malicious actor sends numerous SYN packets without completing the handshake, overwhelming server resources and preventing legitimate connections.

### Immediate Response Actions Taken

**Mitigation Steps:**
- Took web server offline temporarily for recovery
- Configured firewall to block malicious IP (203.0.113.0)
- Implemented continuous traffic monitoring

**Long-term Recommendations:**
- Deploy SYN flood protection mechanisms
- Configure intrusion detection systems
- Establish incident response procedures
